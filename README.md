- Add, delete, and modify fields on the fly.

### Handle Complex Data Structures
- Embrace the power of nested fields to craft intricate and structured schemas.
- Build multi-layered data hierarchies with ease.

### Instant JSON Preview
- Get a real-time preview of your JSON schema as you build it.
- No need to guess how your data will look - see it in action!

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Before diving in, make sure you have React and Ant Design installed in your project. If not, you can easily get them using npm or yarn:

   ```sh
   npm install react antd
   # or
   yarn add react antd
   ```

2. **Import and Use**: Now that you have SchemaBuilder ready, simply import it into your React application and render it:

   ```jsx
   import SchemaBuilder from './SchemaBuilder';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Your Awesome Schema Builder</h1>
         <SchemaBuilder />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Style It Your Way**: To make it look unique, tweak the component's style by adjusting the CSS in the SchemaBuilder.css file to match your design preferences.

## Component Structure

- **Input Fields**: Easily enter data in the "Key," "Value," and "Type" fields.
- **Nested Fields**: Create complex structures by adding nested fields.
- **Add/Delete Buttons**: Use buttons to add new fields and remove the ones you don't need.
- **JSON Preview**: Watch your schema come to life with a real-time JSON preview.
